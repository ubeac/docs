Each sensor data that comes to the uBeac panel should have a sensor type property which is a digit that shows the type of the sensor. If you develop your software devices, you will need to be aware of these types to send a valid sensor data. These sensor types are as below:

| Pressure | 12 |A pressure sensor is a device for pressure measurement of gases or liquids. Pressure is an expression of the force required to stop a fluid from expanding, and is usually stated in terms of force per unit area. A pressure sensor usually acts as a transducer; it generates a signal as a function of the pressure imposed. For the purposes of this article, such a signal is electrical. | [Pascal, bar, atm, Torr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(unit)) | [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_sensor) |

| Gyroscope | 15 | A gyroscope is a device used for measuring or maintaining orientation and angular velocity. It is a spinning wheel or disc in which the axis of rotation is free to assume any orientation by itself. When rotating, the orientation of this axis is unaffected by tilting or rotation of the mounting, according to the conservation of angular momentum. | degree, radians | [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyroscope) |

| Blood Glucose | 21 | The blood sugar level, blood sugar concentration, or blood glucose level is the amount of glucose present in the blood of humans and other animals. Glucose is a simple sugar and approximately 4 grams of glucose are present in the blood of a 70-kilogram (150 lb) human at all times | milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) (mass concentration) | [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar_level) |

|Seismometer| 23 |A seismometer is an instrument that measures ground motions, such as caused by earthquakes, volcanic eruptions,  and explosions | [ML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richter_magnitude_scale) | [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismometer) |
| Torque | 24 | A torque sensor, torque transducer or torque meter is a device for measuring and recording the torque on a rotating system, such as an engine, crankshaft, gearbox, transmission, rotor, a bicycle crank or cap torque tester. Static torque is relatively easy to measure. Dynamic torque, on the other hand, is not easy to measure, since it generally requires transfer of some effect from the shaft being measured to a static system. | Newton-meters (Nm) | [Source](http://www.ni.com/white-paper/14352/en/) |
| Smoke detector | 25 | A smoke detector is a device that senses smoke, typically as an indicator of fire. Commercial security devices issue a signal to a fire alarm control panel as part of a fire alarm system, while household smoke detectors, also known as smoke alarms, generally issue a local audible or visual alarm from the detector itself. | [obscuration](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/obscuration) | [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_detector) |
| Air pollution | 26 | Air pollution sensors are devices that detect and monitor the presence of air pollution in the surrounding area. They can be used for both indoor and outdoor environments. These sensors can be built at home, or bought from certain manufactures. Although there are various types of air pollution sensors, and some are specialized in certain aspects, the majority focuses on five components: ozone, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrous oxide. The sensors were very expensive in the past, but with technological advancements these sensors are becoming more affordable and more widespread throughout the population. These sensors can help serve many purposes and help bring attention to environmental issues beyond the scope of the human eye. | [micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m3)  parts per million (ppm) or parts per billion (ppb)](http://www.ess.co.at/AIR-EIA/units.html)| [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution_sensor) |
| Gas detector | 27 | A gas detector is a device that detects the presence of gases in an area, often as part of a safety system. This type of equipment is used to detect a gas leak or other emissions and can interface with a control system so a process can be automatically shut down. A gas detector can sound an alarm to operators in the area where the leak is occurring, giving them the opportunity to leave. This type of device is important because there are many gases that can be harmful to organic life, such as humans or animals. | [ppm](https://www.equipcoservices.com/support/tutorials/introduction-to-gas-detection/) | [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_detector) |
| Pyranometer | 28 | A pyranometer is a type of actinometer used for measuring solar irradiance on a planar surface and it is designed to measure the solar radiation flux density (W/m2) from the hemisphere above within a wavelength range 0.3 μm to 3 μm. The name pyranometer stems from the Greek words πῦρ (pyr), meaning "fire", and ἄνω (ano), meaning "above, sky". | W/m2 | [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyranometer) |
| Pyrgeometer | 29 | A pyrgeometer is a device that measures near-surface infra-red radiation spectrum in the wavelength spectrum approximately from 4.5 µm to 100 µm. | Meter (m)  | [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrgeometer) |
| Flow | 30 | Flow measurement is the quantification of bulk fluid movement. Flow can be measured in a variety of ways. The common types of flowmeters that find industrial application can be listed as below: a) Obstruction type(differential pressure or variable area) b) Inferential(turbine type) c)electromagnetic d)Positive-displacement flow meters accumulate a fixed volume of fluid and then count the number of times the volume is filled to measure flow. e)fluid dynamic(vortex shedding) f)Anemometer g)Ultrasonic H)Mass flowmeter(Coriolis). | [Both gas and liquid flow can be measured in volumetric or mass flow rates, such as *liters per second or kilograms per second* (Symbol L/s or Kg/s)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volumetric_flow_rate) | [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_sensor) |
| Variometer | 31 | A variometer – also known as a rate of climb and descent indicator (RCDI), rate-of-climb indicator, vertical speed indicator (VSI), or vertical velocity indicator (VVI) – is one of the flight instruments in an aircraft used to inform the pilot of the rate of descent or climb. It can be calibrated in feet per minute, knots or metres per second, depending on country and type of aircraft. | ft/min, knots (1 kn ≈ 100 ft/min), m/s | [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variometer) |
| Capacitive displacement | 32 | Capacitive displacement sensors “are non-contact devices capable of high-resolution measurement of the position and/or change of position of any conductive target”. They are also able to measure the thickness or density of non-conductive materials. Capacitive displacement sensors are used in a wide variety of applications including semiconductor processing, assembly of precision equipment such as disk drives, precision thickness measurements, machine tool metrology and assembly line testing. These types of sensors can be found in machining and manufacturing facilities around the world. | [Farad(F)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farad) | [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitive_displacement_sensor) |
| Impact | 33 | A shock detector or impact monitor is a device which indicates whether a physical shock or impact has occurred. These usually have a binary output (go/no-go) and are sometimes called shock overload devices. Shock detectors can be used on shipments of fragile valuable items to indicate whether a potentially damaging drop or impact may have occurred. They are also used in sports helmets to help estimate if a dangerous impact may have occurred. | [binary output](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_classification) | [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_sensor) |
