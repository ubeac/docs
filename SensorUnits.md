|Centigrade|1|Since the 19th century, the scientific and thermometry communities worldwide have used the phrase centigrade scale. Temperatures on the centigrade scale were often reported simply as degrees or, when greater specificity was desired, as degrees centigrade (symbol: °C).|C|[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature_measurement#Comparison_of_temperature_scales)|
| Fahrenheit | 2 | The Fahrenheit scale is a temperature scale based on one proposed in 1724 by Dutch–German–Polish physicist Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit (1686–1736). | F | [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature_measurement#Comparison_of_temperature_scales)
| Kelvin | 3 | The Kelvin scale is an absolute thermodynamic temperature scale using as its null point absolute zero,the temperature at which all thermal motion ceases in the classical description of thermodynamics.The kelvin (symbol: K) is the base unit of temperature in the International System of Units (SI). | K | - |
| Meter | 5 | The meter is the base unit of length in some metric systems, including the International System of Units (SI). The SI unit symbol is m. | m | - |
| Mile | 8 | The mile is an English unit of length of linear measure equal to 5,280 feet, or 1,760 yards, and standardised as exactly 1,609.344 metres by international agreement in 1959. | mi | - |
| Inch | 9 | The inch is a unit of length in the (British) imperial and United States customary systems of measurement. It is equal to ​1⁄36 yard or ​1⁄12 of a foot. | in | - |
| Foot | 10 | The foot is a unit of length in the imperial and US customary systems of measurement. Since 1959, both units have been defined by international agreement as equivalent to 0.3048 meters exactly. In both systems, the foot comprises 12 inches and three feet compose a yard. | ft | - |
| Yard | 11 | The yard is an English unit of length, in both the British imperial and US customary systems of measurement, that comprises 3 feet or 36 inches. It is by international agreement in 1959 standardized as exactly 0.9144 meters. | yd | - |

| Atmosphere | 16 | The standard atmosphere is a unit of pressure defined as 101325 Pa (1.01325 bar). It is sometimes used as a reference or standard pressure | atm | - |
| Bar | 17 | The bar is a metric unit of pressure, but is not approved as part of the International System of Units (SI). It is defined as exactly equal to 100,000 Pa, which is slightly less than the current average atmospheric pressure on Earth at sea level | bar | - |
| Pascal | 19 | The pascal is the SI derived unit of pressure used to quantify internal pressure, stress, Young's modulus and ultimate tensile strength. It is defined as one newton per square metre. It is named after the French polymath Blaise Pascal. | Pa | - |
| Torr | 21 | The torr (symbol: Torr) is a unit of pressure based on an absolute scale, now defined as exactly 1/760 of a standard atmosphere (101325 Pa). | Torr | - |
| Decibel | 22 | The decibel is a unit of measurement used to express the ratio of one value of a physical property to another on a logarithmic scale. | dB | - |
| Lux | 24 | Luminous flux emitted from a surface | Lx | - |
| Volt | 25 | The volt (symbol: V) is the derived unit for electric potential, electric potential difference, and electromotive force. | V | - |
| Metre per second squared | 26 | The SI unit of acceleration is the metre per second squared (m s−2), or metre per second per second, as the velocity in metres per second changes by the acceleration value, every second. | m/s² | - |
| Tesla | 27 | The tesla (symbol T) is a derived unit of the magnetic field strength (also, magnetic flux density) in the International System of Units. One tesla is equal to one weber per square metre | T | - |
| Degree | 30 | A degree (in full, a degree of arc, arc degree, or arcdegree), usually denoted by ° (the degree symbol), is a measurement of a plane angle, defined so that a full rotation is 360 degrees. | ° | - |
| Radian | 31 | The radian is the SI unit for measuring angles, and is the standard unit of angular measure used in many areas of mathematics. | rad | - |

| Gyroscope | 35 | - | rad/s | - |
| Grams per cubic meter | 40 | This unit is used for humidity | grams/m³ | - |
| Gauss | 41 | The gauss, abbreviated as G or Gs, is the cgs unit of measurement of magnetic flux density (or "magnetic induction") (B). It is named after German mathematician and physicist Carl Friedrich Gauss. One gauss is defined as one maxwell per square centimeter. The cgs system has been superseded by the International System of Units (SI), which uses the tesla (symbol T) as the unit of magnetic flux density. One gauss equals 1×10^−4 tesla (100 μT), so 1 tesla = 10,000 gauss. | G , Gs | [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss_(unit)) |
| Hrtz | 42 | The hertz (symbol: Hz) is the derived unit of frequency in the International System of Units (SI) and is defined as one cycle per second. It is named for Heinrich Rudolf Hertz, the first person to provide conclusive proof of the existence of electromagnetic waves.Description | Hz | [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz) |
| Pound | 43 | The pound or pound-mass is a unit of mass used in the imperial, United States customary and other systems of measurement. Various definitions have been used; the most common today is the international avoirdupois pound, which is legally defined as exactly 0.45359237 kilograms, and which is divided into 16 avoirdupois ounces. | lb | [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(mass)) |
| Newton-meters | 44 | The newton metre (also newton-metre, symbol N m or N⋅m) is a unit of torque (also called moment) in the SI system. One newton metre is equal to the torque resulting from a force of one newton applied perpendicularly to the end of a moment arm that is one metre long. | Nm | [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_metre) |
